    <p>For Part 2:
        I originally planned to do a wind sound, however I changed my mind last minute and decide
        to create a Fire sound instead. I chose to do a Fire Sound because due to the different components and layering of different sound to create a 
        fire sound , I found very interesting. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This project used WebAudio to generate and create sounds. I have two functions in creating the Fire Sound: Creating the Crackle Function  and the Overall Fire Sound Function 
        <br>
        <br>
        Creating the Fire Crackles: 
        <ol>
            <li>Audio Context Initialization: In this step, I create a new seperate Audio Contex using 'window.AudioContext' or 'window.webkitAudioContext' for Part 2. </li>
            <li>Fire Crackle Function: I created a seperate function for Crackle , because I found it would be easier to manage the Crackle sound as this part is the most complicated to 
                create during the whole process in coding the Fire Sound. The algorithm inside this function creates a buffer filled with random noise. 
                The noise is shaped in such a way that it diminishes over time, mimicking the real-world characteristics of a fire crackle. 
                I also added some variation in the loudness of each crackle to make it more natural.
            </li>
            <li> Gain Control: A gain node controls the loudness of each crackle.
                 It's set to a random value, giving each crackle its unique intensity.
            </li>
            <li> Buffer Source and Playback: I used a buffer source to play back the generated crackle. It's connected to the gain node and, subsequently, to the audio context's destination.
                 Each crackle has a short duration and fades out after a brief moment.

            </li>
           
        </ol>

        <br>
        
        The Overall Fire Sound: 
        <br>
        <br> 
        In creating the Fire Sound, based on Farell it has to have these elements: lapping, hissing, crackling, and flames. 
        To be able to create a convincing Fire Sound. Since I created the crackling sound in seperate function, so within this function 
        I will be creating the lapping, hissing, and flames components of the sound and of course, calling the crackling function to create
        the overall fire sound. 
        <ol>
            <li>Noise Buffers: I prepared two noise buffers to provide variety and prevent a repetitive sound.</li>
            <li>Main Crackling Sound Source Nodes: For the primary crackling sound, I create two buffer source nodes, sourceNoise and sourceNoise2. Both are set to loop continuously, ensuring an uninterrupted sound.</li>
            <li>Amplitude Control: Variability is a key to a convincing fire sound. Gain nodes are employed to control the loudness of the main crackling sounds, injecting randomness in their intensity.</li>
            <li>Hissing Sound: Fire often emits a hissing sound. Additional gain nodes and filters shape this hissing component.</li>
            <li>Fire-like Oscillators: To introduce nuances and mimic a natural fire, we include oscillators. The crackleOsc1 and crackleOsc2 generate low-frequency variations reminiscent of real crackling patterns.</li>
            <li>Sound Shaping: Filters, including low-pass and high-pass filters, and waveshapers, help to sculpt the sound and create dynamic textures.</li>
            <li>Inserting the Crackling: To add realism to our simulation, I incorporate a mechanism for triggering random crackling sounds at irregular intervals. This randomness ensures a lifelike and unpredictable fire ambiance.</li>
        </ol>
